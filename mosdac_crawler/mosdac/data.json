Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies. There are 24 files each containing weekly eddy data information for individual year. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products .

Data Version Version 1.0 (beta) Data Sources The daily gridded map of Absolute Dynamic Topography data is obtained from AVISO ftp site ( ftp://ftp.aviso.oceanobs.com ) Website ( http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/ ) Processing Steps Remove the long wavelength component of the SSH anomaly and retain the mesoscale features with the wavelength 50-500 km scale. Identified outer most closed contour of SSH anomaly. The closed contours are sequentially identified, analysed and checked essential criteria. Size and amplitude based thresholds for eddy detection were fixed after carrying out several trials. Eddies are detected and calculated the eddy parameters. Detected eddies are tracked individually.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm We have followed Chelton et. Al. 2007 in deriving the eddy census in Bay of Bengal with minor modifications in fixing the thresholds for eddy detection specific to this region. This was achieved after performing several trial experiments with different combinations of size and amplitude values. Limitations Accuracy assessment of the dataset has not been carried out.

Using interior + surface Quasi-Geostrophic(isQG) methodology, taking Barotropic and first Baroclinic modes, and taking SSHA and SSDA as boundary conditions, ocean interior density and velocity anomaly are reconstructed.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The algorithm is called interior + surface Quasi-Geostrophic(isQG) method. User should refer doi:10.1175/JPO-D-12-0204.1. Limitations This method is only applicable in a region where the Coriolis parameter does not change abruptly. Also it is not applicable on the equator. Vertical movement is ignored in isQG framework. isQG method works well when the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is low. If EKE is large, it will fail to generate accurate subsurface fields. We considered the Barotropic and the first Baroclinic modes only in our analysis. This certainly limits our approach. This method generates less satisfactory subsurface fields if the stratification is strong. The vertical resolution in our case is 10 m. This is a major drawback since in Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer can be as shallow as 15-20 m.

The inputs are sea surface height anomaly (AVISO), sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system (ISAS) climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum. Validation of retrieved density has also been performed using ARGO data which reveals that isQG is more promising when the stratification is weak . 7 Dataset Contact Anup Kumar Mandal, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380015, anupmandal@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update Frequency Six months. 9 Access Rights or Restriction Open Access 10 Spatial Resolution Spatial resolution is 25 km, while vertical resolution is 10m 11 Language English 12 Topic Category Ocean subsurface product (SAMUDRA Project) using satellite data. 13 Keywords Density anomaly, Velocity anomaly, subsurface fields, 3D-Ocean fields 14 Date or period January 2017 - till date 15 Responsible Party Anup Kumar Mandal,OSD/AOGG/ EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India 16 Organization Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, India 16a Org. role Geophysical parameters from satellite data in the Bay of Bengal region. 16b Individual name Anup Kumar Mandal, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, SAC (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India.

It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product. 7 Dataset Contact Aditya Chaudhary, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015, aditya.osd@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update frequency 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa have been processed.

This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features.

The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARAL/ALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products .

Processing Steps Using the daily gridded data of MADT, Vector winds and SST data the Geostrophic, wind driven and buoyancy components of the ocean surface current respectively are first calculated for the off-equatorial regions (3°N to 90°N and 3°S to 90°S). Using the polynomial expansion the equatorial currents (±3° latitude band) are derived. The daily ocean surface current at 0.25° resolution is then derived by applying a linear weighted average procedure to the equatorial and off equatorial current solutions with in the latitude band of ± 3° to ± 4° band.

SSALTO/DUACS user hand book: (M)SLA and (M)ADT Near Real Time and Delayed Time products, AVISO, Nov 2009. Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The methodology follows the work of Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U = (u,v) is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate z , and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity A uniform with depth. The vertical shear U z reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z = - H . Using complex notations U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y , the basic equations are if U = - (1/ρ m ) ∇ p + AU z (1a) (1/ρm) p z = -g + ∇θ (1b) ∇θ = g χ T ∇SST , (1c) with - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions U z (z=0) = τ / A (2a) U z (z = -H) = 0 (2b) The characteristic density is ρ m = 1025 kg m -3 , The acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s -2 , and the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10 -4 K -1 , The vector field τ = τ x + i τ y represents the surface wind stress divided by ρ m , H has been chosen to be 70 m, The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1) b | w| 1 m s -1 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 . The equation for the velocity shear is U z - (if/A) U z = (1/A)∇θ (3) which is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions (2a,b). After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is if U 0 = -g ∇ζ + (1/H ) q(H/h e )τ + ((H/2)/q(H/2he))∇θ (4) Here the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and h e = (A/if ) 1/2 is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth h e = sqrt( 2A/|f|). Using equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). Limitations As the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents. Known problems with data As these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.

Also, hydrological modelling studies face the challenge of decreasing availability of in-situ monitoring data. However, application of satellite radar altimetry over the inland water bodies becomes vital tool to estimate water levels through waveform retracking on satellite altimetry?s sensor data. SARAL-Altika was launched on 25 February 2013. It is a joint-mission of CNES France and ISRO to provide continuous monitoring of ocean and continental water surface. It was launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790km with 35 days of orbit repetition and follows same ground track as ENVISAT satellite. It has 98.55 deg of inclination with 75 km of equatorial cross track separation. It has Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter. Water level product for inland water bodies (presently for Brahmaputra river and Ukai Reservoir) has been generated using the SARAL-ALTIKA waveform data.

The radar reflectivity has been corrected for clutter using a combination of a spatial continuity filter and a fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm. The velocity folded regions are dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing algorithm. The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity are then gridded into 1 km x 1 km x 250 m 3D volumetric grid which can be used by scientists for further meteorological applications.

Accurate and timely advance prediction of tropical cyclones is very important to disseminate the warnings and preparedness. Prediction of development of any cyclone system in the North Indian Ocean is being done at Space Applications Centre (ISRO) Ahmedabad, using the in-house developed algorithms. Once the low-pressure system is formed, it is continuously monitored by satellite observations. The forecasts like cyclogenesis, track, intensity and landfall of cyclones, ship avoidance region, storm surge, coastal inundation etc. and satellite based cyclone information are disseminated through web-portal SCORPIO.

Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies.

Identified outer most closed contour of SSH anomaly. The closed contours are sequentially identified, analysed and checked essential criteria. Size and amplitude based thresholds for eddy detection were fixed after carrying out several trials. Eddies are detected and calculated the eddy parameters. Detected eddies are tracked individually.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The algorithm is called interior + surface Quasi-Geostrophic(isQG) method. User should refer doi:10.1175/JPO-D-12-0204.1. Limitations This method is only applicable in a region where the Coriolis parameter does not change abruptly. Also it is not applicable on the equator. Vertical movement is ignored in isQG framework. isQG method works well when the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is low. If EKE is large, it will fail to generate accurate subsurface fields. We considered the Barotropic and the first Baroclinic modes only in our analysis. This certainly limits our approach. This method generates less satisfactory subsurface fields if the stratification is strong. The vertical resolution in our case is 10 m. This is a major drawback since in Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer can be as shallow as 15-20 m.

It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product. 7 Dataset Contact Aditya Chaudhary, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015, aditya.osd@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update frequency 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa have been processed.

The primary input datasets utilized are sea surface salinity data from the SMAP mission and sea surface currents derived from altimetry. These datasets are obtained at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The SMAP mission has been operational since 2015, whereas altimetry-derived sea surface currents have been available since 1993. Validation of this reconstructed product was conducted against in-situ datasets obtained from thermo-salinographs. Results indicate that the reconstructed product more accurately captures front formation compared to the original SMAP salinity fields.

This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream.

The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARAL/ALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products .

Processing Steps Using the daily gridded data of MADT, Vector winds and SST data the Geostrophic, wind driven and buoyancy components of the ocean surface current respectively are first calculated for the off-equatorial regions (3°N to 90°N and 3°S to 90°S). Using the polynomial expansion the equatorial currents (±3° latitude band) are derived. The daily ocean surface current at 0.25° resolution is then derived by applying a linear weighted average procedure to the equatorial and off equatorial current solutions with in the latitude band of ± 3° to ± 4° band.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The methodology follows the work of Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U = (u,v) is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate z , and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity A uniform with depth. The vertical shear U z reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z = - H . Using complex notations U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y , the basic equations are if U = - (1/ρ m ) ∇ p + AU z (1a) (1/ρm) p z = -g + ∇θ (1b) ∇θ = g χ T ∇SST , (1c) with - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions U z (z=0) = τ / A (2a) U z (z = -H) = 0 (2b) The characteristic density is ρ m = 1025 kg m -3 , The acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s -2 , and the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10 -4 K -1 , The vector field τ = τ x + i τ y represents the surface wind stress divided by ρ m , H has been chosen to be 70 m, The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1) b | w| 1 m s -1 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 . The equation for the velocity shear is U z - (if/A) U z = (1/A)∇θ (3) which is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions (2a,b). After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is if U 0 = -g ∇ζ + (1/H ) q(H/h e )τ + ((H/2)/q(H/2he))∇θ (4) Here the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and h e = (A/if ) 1/2 is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth h e = sqrt( 2A/|f|). Using equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). Limitations As the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents. Known problems with data As these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.

Also, hydrological modelling studies face the challenge of decreasing availability of in-situ monitoring data. However, application of satellite radar altimetry over the inland water bodies becomes vital tool to estimate water levels through waveform retracking on satellite altimetry?s sensor data. SARAL-Altika was launched on 25 February 2013. It is a joint-mission of CNES France and ISRO to provide continuous monitoring of ocean and continental water surface. It was launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790km with 35 days of orbit repetition and follows same ground track as ENVISAT satellite. It has 98.55 deg of inclination with 75 km of equatorial cross track separation. It has Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter. Water level product for inland water bodies (presently for Brahmaputra river and Ukai Reservoir) has been generated using the SARAL-ALTIKA waveform data.

The range information is estimated based on the arrival time of the radar pulse. This range is then corrected for Dry tropospheric correction, wet tropospheric correction, ionospheric correction, and tidal correction, i.e. Load tide, solid earth tide. Detailed information about the range corrections can be found in the ATBD document (S. Chander and Prakash Chauhan, 2013) of the SARAL mission.

It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1°X 0.1° on a latitude/longitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) algorithm (Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022) with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared (IR) technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared (MVK) combined (Mega et al. 2019). A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. (2022).

Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc हिन्दी Missions SARAL-AltiKa Introduction Objectives SpaceCraft Payloads Data Products Documents Search Search Follow Us Website owned and maintained by MOSDAC, Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Govt. of INDIA.

IMAGER The INSAT-3DR imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band. T he Imager is an improved design of VHRR-2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution. This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects.

A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional maps of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere. T he Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.

It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1°X 0.1° on a latitude/longitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) algorithm (Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022) with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared (IR) technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared (MVK) combined (Mega et al. 2019). A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. (2022).

The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget, Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and  Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR  provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels.  A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products. Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data. Data Version Version 1.1 (beta) Data Sources SAPHIR Level 1A TB data Processing Steps SAPHIR Level-1 brightness temperature of channel-6 (Tb6) and spatial variability of Tb6 (Std-tb6) within ±3 pixels (~30km at nadir and ~60km off nadir) is calculated. Bayesian algorithm is trained using GPM-IMERG half hourly rainfall Bayesian approach is applied to estimate rainfall from SAPHIR sounder observations. References Kummerow, C.D., W. S. Olson, and L.

The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget and Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and  Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR  provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels.  A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation. 7 Dataset Contact Neerja Sharma and Kaushik Gopalan, GRD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380015, kaushikg@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update Frequency January 2017 to May 2018 have been processed.

Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc हिन्दी Missions SARAL-AltiKa Introduction Objectives SpaceCraft Payloads Data Products Documents Search Search Follow Us Website owned and maintained by MOSDAC, Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Govt. of INDIA.

The VHRR observes in VIS, water vapor and TIR bands providing a spatial resolution of 2 km in VIS band and 8 km for the rest. VHRR was developed by SAC (Satellite Application Center), Ahmedabad, India. The instrument operates in three scanning modes: Full frame mode (20° North-South x 20° East-West), minimum in about 33 minutes covering the entire Earth disk Normal frame mode (14° N-S x 20° E-W), minimum in about 23 minutes Sector frame mode in which the sector can be positioned anywhere in steps of 0.5° in the N-S direction to cover 4.5° N-S x 20° E-W. This mode is particularly suited for rapid, repetitive coverage during severe weather conditions like a cyclone. The nominal frame repetition rates are: 40, 30 and 20 minutes respectively. VHRR is an opto-mechanical system (whiskbroom type imager). The incoming solar radiation is reflected onto a Ritchey-Chretien telescope of 20 cm aperture by a beryllium scan mirror mounted at 45° to the optical axis. The optical system includes a gold-film dichoric beam-splitter that transmits visible light energy and reflects WV/TIR energy, so that the radiation from the Earth is channelized to the visible and IR focal planes simultaneously. The visible band detector configuration consists of two staggered arrays of four silicon photodiodes each; while two sets of mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT) detector elements operating nominally at 100-110 K sense the WV/thermal radiation. The scan mirror is mounted on a two-axis, gimballed scan mechanism system to generate a 2-D image by sweeping the detector instantaneous field of view (FOV) across the Earth's surface in east to west (fast scan) and north to south (slow scan).

The objective is to collect data from unattended meteorological platforms in the ground segment. DRT receives receives signals from unattended weather data collection platforms and retransmits them to the central station. The data from these payloads are being used for comprehensive weather status and forecasting. RF communication of DRT: Uplink frequency = 402.75 MHz; downlink frequency = 4506.05 MHz; bandwidth =± 100 kHz; EIRP = 21 dBW (min). Note: MetSat-1 does not carry SAS&R (Satellite Aided Search and Rescue) system. In the INSAT-2 series, the INSAT-2A and -2B satellites carried SAS&R transponders as well as DRTs (Data Relay Transponders). According to ISRO information, INSAT-3A (launch April 9, 2003) and INSAT-3D (to be launched subsequently), will carry SAS&R and DRT payloads.

MetSat has been designed using a new spacecraft bus (I-1000 bus) employing lightweight structural elements like CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic). A central structural thrust cylinder provides mounting interfaces propellant tanks, pressurant tank, equipment panels, payload, solar array assembly, and with the launch vehicle. Structural brackets are provided to mount momentum wheels, reaction wheel, RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters, earth sensors, sun sensors, LAM (Liquid Apogee Motor), and propulsion components. MetSat-1 is three-axis stabilized (momentum biased control subsystem). However, unlike its INSAT predecessors, the MetSat-1 spacecraft does not feature a sail/boom design. The attitude is sensed by suite of sensors (gyros, Earth sensors, digital sun sensor, coarse analog sun sensors, and solar panel sun sensor). Magnetic torquers serve as actuators to unload the momentum of the wheels. In addition, active thrusters are used (one 440N LAM for orbit raising maneuvers and eight 22 N thrusters for orbit and attitude control). The propulsion system employed is a unified bi-propellant with mono-methyl hydrazine (MMH) as fuel and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON3) as oxidizer. The S/C employs passive thermal control system by utilizing multi-layer insulation blankets, optical solar reflectors, heat sinks, paints, thermal grease, thermal shields etc. The temperature of individual subsystems spread over the satellite is maintained by a bank of 112 heaters. EPS (Electrical Power Subsystem): Electrical power of 550 W is generated by a single panel solar array of 2.15 m x 1.85 m using GaAS solar cells. The solar panel features a drive mechanism to point it into the sun. A single NiCd battery (18 Ah capacity) provides power for eclipse phases. The SADA (Solar Array Driver Assembly) slip rings and drive mechanism are modified to meet the power transfer and drive requirements, it is mass-optimized. The spacecraft has a launch mass of 1055 kg including 560 kg of propellant (495 kg S/C dry mass). MetSat-1 has a design life of 7 years with an operational goal of 10 years.

IMAGER The INSAT-3D imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band. T he Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution. This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors. Key Parameters of the Imager Telescope aperture 310 mm diameter Number of bands (6) 0.52 - 0.72 µm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 µm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 µm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 µm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 µm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 µm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared) Spatial resolution 1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2 Band separation, band definition Beam splitter, interference filters IFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) 28 µrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 µrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 µrad for WV (8 km) Sampling interval 1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV Scan step angle Linear in E-W direction (8 µR step size) Line step 224 µrad in N-S direction Scan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration 200º/s +0.2 s turnaround time 56 µR (peak to peak) Full aperture blackbody and spaceview Scan modes Full, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity Frame time 25 minutes for normal mode Signal quantization 10 bit/sample Downlink data rate 4.0 Mbit/s SOUNDER The INSAT-3D sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere. T he Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.

The radiometer is designed to estimate atmospheric water parameters and wind speed in the equatorial belt. The choice of the channels has been driven by their potential contribution to the measurement of the parameters defined above.

For realizing that performance, it is necessary to choose channels for which the atmospheric contribution to the radiance comes from different levels of the troposphere. This can be obtained by sampling an absorption line of water vapour by channels more or less close to the centre of the line. A candidate line, already chosen for other instruments, is the line at 183.3 GHz. It is possible to get contribution functions peaking from heights of 2 km.up to 10 to 12 km in tropical redundant to use more than 5 channels. A sixth complimentary channel in a window regions has to be used to correct for the surface effects in the lowest channels; the 150 channel of MADRAS can be used for that.

The excess energy is transported to temperate regions by the motion of atmosphere and oceans. Any variation in the energy budget of the tropics will therefore effect the whole planet. The energy exchanges are strongly linked to the water cycle and particularly to the tropical connective systems: huge amount of latent heat are released in the tropical rains, while high humidity and thick clouds strongly affect the radiation budget. Many interactions between radiation, water vapour, clouds, precipitation and atmospheric motion determine the life cycle of convective cloud systems, and the occurrence of extreme events like tropical cyclones, monsoons, flood and droughts. Due to dynamic nature of above parameters, the frequency of observation from low orbiting sun-synchronous orbits is inadequate. Only geo-stationary satellites allow continuous monitoring of the Tropics, but their Vis-IR sensors give limited information on the cloud surface properties or horizontal distribution of water vapour. Low orbiting (~800 km) satellites with low inclinations provide high repetitivity. An inclination at 20 degrees provides 6 observations of each point on the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The most energetic tropical systems, such as the cloud clusters of ITCZ, the Monsoon systems and the Tropical cyclones, extend over hundreds of kilometers. Hence, a ground resolution of about 10 km is adequate for these observations. In order to meet most of the above requirements, Megha Tropiques has been envisaged which is low earth orbit (LEO) mission. Megha in Sanskrit is ‘cloud’ and Tropiques in French is ‘tropics’. Megha-tropiques Mission is an ISRO-CNES (Indo-French) collaborative programme intended for studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics using a satellite platform. Megha-Tropiques is a one-tonne satellite which will be operated as part of a joint programme between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and France′s Centre National d′Etudes Spaciales (CNES). The spacecraft was constructed by ISRO, based around the IRS bus developed for earlier Indian satellites, and carries four instruments which will be used to study the Earth′s atmosphere. ISRO is responsible of the system and the satellite. ISRO provides the launcher, the paltform, part of the MADRAS instrument, the GPS receiver and the mission operation center, which will process all the products until level 1. ISRO also performs the integration and test of the MADRAS instrument, of the complete payload and of the satellite. CNES provides a support for the system activities, the hyperfrequency part of the MADRAS instrument (MARFEQ) developped under contract by ASTRIUM, and the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments developped by CNES with a support of the LMD, LERMA and CETP laboratories. CNES also provides the data processing algorithms for the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments and participates to the development of the MADRAS data processing algorithms. A data and instruments performances expertise center will be created in France. For the French part, the level 2 and upper data processing will be realised in the thematic center Icare. Megha Tropiques Ground Segment The ground segment is divided into: 1. A satellite operation ground segment providedby India: an S-band telemetry and command station a satellite monitoring and control center 2. A science ground segment including Indian and French parts: an S-band mission station for payload telemetry located in India a mission operation center located in India a level-2 processing center in India such as MOSDAC a level-2 processing center named ICARE in France The Megha-Tropiques satellite is launched by an Indian PSLV launcher in 2011, on a 867 km orbit with an inclination of 20°.

Ocean meso-scale variability is defined as a class of high-energy processes, with wave lengths within a 50km to 500km range, and with periods of a few days to one year. Kinetic energy of mesoscale variability is one order of magnitude more than mean circulation's one. Description of mesoscale is thus essential for understanding ocean dynamics, including mean circulation and its climatic effects (through interactions of meso-scale turbulence with the mean flow). SARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is divided in sub-themes including: Intrinsic scientific studies of ocean at meso-scale dynamics: observations, theoretical analyses, modelling, data assimilation, parameterization, ... Improvement of our understanding of the oceanic component in the climate system: investigation of local processes at small or medium scale poorly known and understood at present, but which have an impact on the modelling of climate variability at large spatial and temporal scales. Contribution to the study of coastal dynamic processes, especially small or medium scale phenomena, whose retrieval will enable to anticipate many downstream applications. Contribution to operational oceanography which is seeking large amounts of in situ and space observation data. SARAL/AltiKa secondary objectives are notably the monitoring of the main continental waters level (lakes, rivers, closed seas), the monitoring of mean sea level variations, the observation of polar oceans, the analysis and forecast of wave and wind fields, the study of continental ices (thanks to improved performances of Ka-band) and sea ices, the access to low rains climatology (enabled in counterpart to the sensitivity of Ka-band to clouds and low rains) and the marine biogeochemistry (notably through the role of the meso and sub-meso-scale physics).

Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies.

Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) SCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90 0 and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60 0 on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days. Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA) ROSA is a new GPS occultation receiver provided by ASI (Italian Space Agency). The objective is to characterize the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, opening the possibilities for the development of several scientific activities exploiting these new radio occultation data sets.

IMAGER The INSAT-3DS imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band. T he Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution. This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors. Key Parameters of the Imager Telescope aperture 310 mm diameter Number of bands (6) 0.52 - 0.72 µm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 µm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 µm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 µm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 µm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 µm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared) Spatial resolution 1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2 Band separation, band definition Beam splitter, interference filters IFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) 28 µrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 µrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 µrad for WV (8 km) Sampling interval 1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV Scan step angle Linear in E-W direction (8 µR step size) Line step 224 µrad in N-S direction Scan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration 200º/s +0.2 s turnaround time 56 µR (peak to peak) Full aperture blackbody and spaceview Scan modes Full, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity Frame time 25 minutes for normal mode Signal quantization 10 bit/sample Downlink data rate 4.0 Mbit/s SOUNDER The INSAT-3DS sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere. T he Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere.

Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) SCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at SAC/ISRO, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 25 x 25 km. The parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90 0 and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60 0 on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.
